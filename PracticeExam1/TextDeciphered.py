#For this question, your goal is to decipher a text message to plain English.
#You can ignore grammar, you're just translating common text slang into
#normal words.
#
#Write a function called text_deciphered. text_deciphered should have two
#parameters: a string representing a text message, and a dictionary representing
#a set of known abbreviations. In this dictionary, the keys are the English words
#and the values are the abbreviated words.
#
#Return a translated version of the string, replacing the abbreviated words with
#the real English words.
#
#For example:
#text_message = "Hey, wat r our plans for tn"
#abbrevs = {"what": "wat", "are": "r", "tonight": "tn"}
#text_deciphered(text_message, abbrevs) -> "Hey, what are our plans for tonight"


#Write your code here!

    for key, value in dictionary.items():
