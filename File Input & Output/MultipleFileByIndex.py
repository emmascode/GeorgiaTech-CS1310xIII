#Write a function called multiply_file_by_index. This function
#should take two parameters, both strings. The first string is
#the filename of a file to which to write (output_file), and
#the second string is the filename of a file from which to read
#(input_file).
#
#In the input file, there will be an integer on every line.
#To the output file, you should write the integer from the
#original file multiplied by the line number on which it
#appeared. You should assume that the first line of the file
#is line 1 (which is different from a list, where the first item
#is at index 0).
#
#For example, if the input file contained this text:
#1
#4
#3
#7
#6
#
#Then the output file would contain this text:
#1
#8
#9
#28
#30


#Add your code here!
def multiply_file_by_index(output_file, input_file):
    output_file = open(output_file, 'w')
    input_file = open(input_file, 'r')
    counter = 1
    for i in input_file:
        print(type(i), 'before')
        aVal = int(i) * counter
        print(type(i), 'after')
        output_file.writelines(str(aVal) + '\n')
        counter += 1
    input_file.close()
    output_file.close()
       
        
    


#The code below will test your function. You can find the two
#files it references in the drop-down in the top left. If your
#code works, output_file.txt should have the text:
#1
#8
#9
#28
#30
multiply_file_by_index("output_file.txt", "input_file.txt")
print("Done running! Check output_file.txt for the result.")

#If you accidentally erase input_file.txt, here's its original
#text to copy back in (remove the pound signs):
#1
#4
#3
#7
#6
